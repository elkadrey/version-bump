# Version Bump - Composer Plugin

A Composer plugin that allows you to manage versioning similar to `npm version`. It supports `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `prepatch`, `preminor`, `premajor`, and `prerelease` versioning while integrating with Git for tagging and commits.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Easily update version numbers in `composer.json`
- Automatically commit and tag new versions in Git
- Supports **pre-release versions** (`beta`)
- Compatible with **semantic versioning (SemVer)**

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
Install the plugin globally or in a specific project:

```sh
composer require elkadrey/version-bump --dev
```

If using locally, require it as a **path repository**:
```sh
composer config repositories.version-bump '{"type": "path", "url": "../path-to-plugin"}'
composer require elkadrey/version-bump:dev-main
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Usage
Run the following command to manage versioning:

```sh
composer version <command>
```

Set a specific version manually:
```sh
composer version <version>
```
This will set the version in `composer.json` to exactly what `<version>` is.
